# mm1-map-creator
Tool for creating maps for the Might &amp; Magic 1 (1986) game. Created on C#, Visual Studio using Windows Forms API and GDI.

The Might &amp; Magic 1 (1986) RPG encourages the player to create maps of game locations by using paper and pencil. This tool enables you to do it directly on your computer using virtual "paper" and "pencil", therefore playing the game as intended.

The tool is made to use as little space as possible for using on laptops and therefore do not have any buttons. Instead you should use hotkeys, for list of hotkeys push the "F1" key.
